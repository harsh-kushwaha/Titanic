# Titanic
A classification problem related to predicting a passenger's survival in the Titanic sinking disaster. Started the problem by viewing, analysing and visualizing the relation and estimated effects of different features with the dependent variable i.e. 'Survival'. Visualised each variable by means of various graphs like histograms, bar graphs, point plots using matplotlib and seaborn libraries(Univariate analysis). Completed the train and test dataset by filling the features having missing values with median for numeric datatype and mode for categorical datatype. Performed feature engineering to exclude features having negligible importance in the prediction and created new features using the combination of two or more features. Visualised the relation of the new features with the dependent variable (Bivariate Analysis). Classified the categorical data into various bands. Developed and compared different models based on their accuracy scores using different classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision trees, Random Forests. Parameter tuning was also done for all these models. An accuracy score of 75.5% was finally obtained using Logistic Regression based model.
