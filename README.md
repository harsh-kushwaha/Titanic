# Titanic
A classification problem related to predicting a passenger's survival in the Titanic sinking disaster. Started the problem by viewing, analysing and visualizing the relation and estimated effects of different features with the dependent variable i.e. 'Survival'. Visualised each variable by means of various graphs like histograms, bar graphs, point plots using matplotlib and seaborn libraries. Completed the train and test dataset by filling the features having missing values with mean for numeric datatype and mode for categorical datatype. Performed feature engineering to exclude features having negligible importance in the prediction. Used One-Hot Encoding to deal with the categorical variables. Developed and compared different models based on their accuracy scores using Logistic Regression(Accuracy Score = 0.8), Decision Tree(Accuracy Score = 0.82) and Random Forest(Accuracy Score= 0.79) classification algorithms.
